# Adaptive-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Congestion-Prediction-Across-Urban-and-Suburban-Road-Networks
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing adaptive machine learning models to predict traffic congestion in both urban and suburban road networks. The models dynamically learn from traffic patterns and external factors to improve prediction accuracy over time, enabling smarter traffic management and reducing commute times.

Features
Adaptive learning algorithms that update based on new data

Multi-modal data integration including traffic volume, weather, and temporal features

Comparative analysis of models across urban and suburban settings

Visualization of congestion prediction results
